# Reflections and Takeaway 

***********************************************************************
## Biggest takeaway from this class
Before taking this class, I already had an enriching experience in Python coding. However, my coding experience mostly is about deep learning and machine learning, I do not have experience in data visualization, but the most common method of visualizing data in my previous projects is plotting line or bar charts using the matplotlib package. It is kind of boring and pretty normal. Therefore, I was very excited when I discovered this class, I immediately realized: I need to take this class, it will be very useful. After reading the syllabus, I think it's perfect for me. Matplotlib package will be introduced at the beginning, and then other advanced packages like ipywidgets, seaborn, bqplot, and the data formatting and data cleaning also were introduced in the class. This comprehensive approach is exactly what I need to make my research projects more attractive. One of my favourite sections is exploring data visualization examples. I learned lots of new and cool ideas in data visualization. In conclusion, this class has been immensely rewarding. It has expanded my skill set's, broadened my horizons and heightened my awareness of the intricacies behind visual data representation.

## Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher
I think Professor Uhe already did a great job as a teacher. He helped us fix bug and answered questions and gave good advice on projects and homeworks. From personal points, I hope Professor Uhe could talk about some examples on how to present biological and chemical data (my filed). But I know we need to consider all students. Anyway, I don't think there is anything Professor Uhe needs to improve, he is great.
